This "csvs" directory is from Max Ogden's csv-spectrum GitHub repository and some of its forks. The "json" directory is
different and my own since I don't want to consider the first line as a special header line.

For full transparency, I have enumerated where each test case came from:

Repository: https://github.com/maxogden/csv-spectrum
  - comma_in_quotes
  - empty
  - empty_crlf
  - escaped_quotes
  - json
  - newlines
  - newlines_crlf
  - quotes_and_newlines
  - simple
  - simple_crlf
  - utf8

Repository: https://github.com/calvinmetcalf/csv-spectrum
  - null
    NOTE: I modified this test case to consider an unquoted NULL as a literal NULL instead of an empty string.

Repository: https://github.com/finnp/csv-spectrum
  - newlines_cr
